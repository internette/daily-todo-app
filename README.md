### What is it?

Daily_ToDo is a desktop application designed to encourage daily habits by rewarding users the satisfaction of checking off daily tasks. To learn more, you can visit the [Daily_ToDo site](https://acjanus.co/daily-todo). Help make your mornings more productive, finally practice that skill regularly, or just remind yourself to drink a glass of water before bed. The use cases are endless.

### Specs

Daily_ToDo is built on ElectronJS, React, and Redux. This app uses an [NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-config) plus Electron's built in IPC messaging system to store tasks daily. The described approach means no server, 100% offline support.
